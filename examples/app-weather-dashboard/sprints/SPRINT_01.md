Owner: Alex M / Product Lead

## 1) Sprint goal
Deliver a working single-page view that fetches and displays current weather + 5-day forecast for a searched city.

## 2) Scope (selected from BACKLOG.md)
- TD-001 — Set up project structure
- BL-001 — City search input
- BL-002 — Fetch & display current weather
- BL-003 — Fetch & display 5-day forecast

## 3) Definition of Done (for this sprint)
- [ ] All scoped items meet their DoD
- [ ] No console errors in Chrome / Firefox
- [ ] Page loads and renders in < 2 s on 4G
- [ ] Notes updated (PRD/TDD as needed)

## 4) Plan (simple)
- Day 1–2: TD-001 + BL-001 (project setup + search input)
- Day 3–5: BL-002 (API integration + current weather card)
- Day 6–8: BL-003 (forecast row)
- Day 9–10: Polish, test, prep demo

## 5) Demo checklist
- [ ] Open index.html in browser

- [ ] 5-day forecast row shows 5 cards with day names + high/low
- [ ] Type invalid city → friendly error message appears
- [ ] Page feels fast and responsive
