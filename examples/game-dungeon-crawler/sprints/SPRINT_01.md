# Sprint 01 — Core Grid & Movement
Dates: 2026-02-10 → 2026-02-21
Owner: Sam L / Game Lead

## 1) Sprint goal
Get a player moving through a procedurally generated floor with visible enemies — proving the core grid, generation, and turn system work.

## 2) Scope (selected from BACKLOG.md)
- TD-001 — Set up project structure
- TD-002 — Add basic state machine
- BL-001 — Floor generation (BSP)
- BL-002 — Player movement (turn-based)
- BL-003 — Enemy spawning & AI

## 3) Definition of Done (for this sprint)
- [ ] All scoped items meet their DoD
- [ ] No console errors in Chrome / Firefox
- [ ] Game runs at 60 FPS on a mid-range laptop
- [ ] Notes updated (GDD/TDD as needed)

## 4) Plan (simple)
- Day 1–2: TD-001 + TD-002 (project structure + state machine)
- Day 3–5: BL-001 (BSP floor generation + connectivity validation)
- Day 6–7: BL-002 (player movement + camera)
- Day 8–10: BL-003 (enemy spawning + simple chase AI) + polish + demo

## 5) Demo checklist
- [ ] Open index.html — title screen appears
- [ ] Press Start — a procedurally generated floor renders
- [ ] Arrow keys move player tile-by-tile
- [ ] Walls block movement
- [ ] Enemies are visible and chase the player
- [ ] Refresh page — floor layout is different
